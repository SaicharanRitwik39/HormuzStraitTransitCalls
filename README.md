# # 🚢 Hormuz Strait Transit Calls

I built this app because Hormuz Strait questions repeated last year and this year as well. Instead of running the same script over and over on my machine, I figured—why not just make a simple Streamlit app that does it for me (and others) anytime, anywhere?

## 🔍 Purpose
- Displays data on ship transits through the Strait of Hormuz.
- Offers a fast and repeatable method for referencing the latest numbers.
- Helps forecasters save time and stay calibrated with updated info.
